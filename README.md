# dl8006-logo.bin
a backup of the "extracts" which will be used to create a darkmode boot logo, as well as some notes.

# Development:
- The utility I'm using for this is Logo Builder, which can be found [here](https://xdaforums.com/t/changing-boot-logo-logo-bin-program.1953726/)
- All the copyright attributes go to the respective owner(s), if any.
- These bitmaps are from the "true" logo.bin, also known as the one which says "Digiland" instead of "Everest Digiland".
- These bitmaps are in a 800x1280@32bit format.

Each branch will be different, and will resemble the creative works of the branch maintainer. The following naming scheme will be used to help differentiate between branches:
[one-word-description]-[maintainer-github-username]

The [main] branch will not have any contributions done to it past the uploading of the files. The reason for this is that the [main] branch serves as a template.
The [11-May-2017] branch will be an exact copy of the main branch but will NOT be used as a template. It serves the purpose of archiving the original files.
{More descriptions will be added as time goes on}
